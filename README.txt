Task Manager Dashboard
======================

Files:
- index.html       -> Main HTML file (links to Bootstrap CDN)
- styles.css       -> Custom CSS (animations, layout tweaks)
- script.js        -> All JavaScript (ES6) handling tasks, storage, theme
- TaskManagerDashboard.zip -> This zipped project

How to run:
1. Download and unzip the folder.
2. Open index.html in a modern browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox).
3. The app uses localStorage to persist tasks and theme choice.

Notes:
- Default theme: light.
- Dark mode toggle is in the navbar and persists across reloads.
- Tasks can be added, edited (modal), marked complete, filtered, searched, and deleted.
